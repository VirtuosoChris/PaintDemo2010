For a UCF Game Design Group Project in 2010.
I made this as a rapid feasibility prototype / cool visual aid for our group's game design presentation, "Epic Mona Lisa", which had the user painting the environment for different effects.

It was an excuse to do a "permanent decal" system by uniquely texturing the environment with a layer of writable render targets, since I thought that was neat and at the time (and still today) it really bothers me when all the impact I have on the environment in a game (blood, bullet holes, etc) just fade away after a short time.
